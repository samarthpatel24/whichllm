```text
$ whichllm --gpu "RTX 4090"

#1  Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B     27.8B  Q5_K_M   score 92.8    27 t/s
#2  Qwen/Qwen3-32B       32.0B  Q4_K_M   score 83.0    31 t/s
#3  Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B   30.0B  Q5_K_M   score 82.7   102 t/s
```

The 32B model **fits your card fine** — whichllm still ranks the 27B #1,
because it scores higher on real benchmarks and is a newer generation.
A size-only "what fits?" tool would hand you the bigger one. That gap is
the whole point of whichllm. (Note #3: a MoE model at 102 t/s — speed is
ranked on *active* params, quality on *total*.)

### What can I run?

Real top picks (snapshot 2026-05 — your results track **live** HuggingFace
data, this is not a static list):

| Hardware | VRAM | Top pick | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 5090 | 32 GB | `Qwen3.6-27B` · Q6_K · score 94.7 | ~40 t/s |
| RTX 4090 / 3090 | 24 GB | `Qwen3.6-27B` · Q5_K_M · score 92.8 | ~27 t/s |
| RTX 4060 | 8 GB | `Qwen3-14B` · Q3_K_M · score 71.0 | ~22 t/s |
| Apple M3 Max | 36 GB | `Qwen3.6-27B` · Q5_K_M · score 89.4 | ~9 t/s |
| CPU only | — | `gpt-oss-20b` (MoE) · Q4_K_M · score 45.2 | ~6 t/s |

`whichllm --gpu "<your card>"` to simulate any of these before you buy.

## Star History

## Why whichllm?

Fitting a model into your VRAM is the easy part. The hard part is knowing
**which of the models that fit is actually the best** — and that is what
whichllm is built to get right.

- **Evidence-based ranking, not a size heuristic** — The top pick is
  chosen from merged real benchmarks (LiveBench, Artificial Analysis,
  Aider, multimodal/vision, Chatbot Arena ELO, Open LLM Leaderboard) —
  never "the biggest model that happens to fit."
- **Recency-aware** — Stale leaderboards are demoted along each model's
  lineage, so a 2024 model can't outrank a current-generation one on an
  outdated score. The benchmark snapshot date is printed under every
  ranking, so a stale recommendation is self-evident instead of silently
  trusted.
- **Evidence-graded and guarded** — Every score is tagged
  `direct` / `variant` / `base` / `interpolated` / `self-reported` and
  discounted by confidence. Fabricated uploader claims and cross-family
  inheritance (a small fork borrowing its much larger base's score) are
  actively rejected.
- **Architecture-aware estimates** — VRAM = weights + GQA KV cache +
  activation + overhead; speed is bandwidth-bound with per-quant
  efficiency, per-backend factors, MoE active-vs-total split, and
  unified-memory vs discrete-PCIe partial-offload modeling.
- **One command, scriptable** — `whichllm` prints the answer; add
  `--json | jq` for pipelines. No TUI, no keybindings to memorize.
- **Live data** — Models fetched directly from the HuggingFace API, with
  curated frozen fallbacks for offline or rate-limited use.

## Features

- **Auto-detect hardware** — NVIDIA, AMD, Apple Silicon, CPU-only
- **Smart ranking** — Scores models by VRAM fit, speed, and benchmark quality
- **One-command chat** — `whichllm run` downloads and starts a chat session instantly
- **Code snippets** — `whichllm snippet` prints ready-to-run Python for any model
- **Live data** — Fetches models directly from HuggingFace (cached for performance)
- **Benchmark-aware** — Integrates real eval scores with confidence-based dampening
- **Task profiles** — Filter by general, coding, vision, or math use cases
- **GPU simulation** — Test with any GPU: `whichllm --gpu "RTX 4090"`
- **Hardware planning** — Reverse lookup: `whichllm plan "llama 3 70b"`
- **JSON output** — Pipe-friendly: `whichllm --json`

## Run & Snippet

**Try any model with a single command.** No manual installs needed — whichllm creates an isolated environment via `uv`, installs dependencies, downloads the model, and starts an interactive chat.

![run demo](assets/demo-run.gif)

```bash
# Chat with a model (auto-picks the best GGUF variant)
whichllm run "qwen 2.5 1.5b gguf"

# Auto-pick the best model for your hardware and chat
whichllm run

# CPU-only mode
whichllm run "phi 3 mini gguf" --cpu-only
```

Works with **all model formats**:
- **GGUF** — via `llama-cpp-python` (lightweight, fast)
- **AWQ / GPTQ** — via `transformers` + `autoawq` / `auto-gptq`
- **FP16 / BF16** — via `transformers`

Get a **copy-paste Python snippet** instead:

```bash
whichllm snippet "qwen 7b"
```

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama.from_pretrained(
    repo_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF",
    filename="qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf",
    n_ctx=4096,
    n_gpu_layers=-1,
    verbose=False,
)

output = llm.create_chat_completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(output["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

```

## Integrations

### Ollama

Find the best model and run it directly:

```bash
# Pick the top model and run it with Ollama
whichllm --top 1 --json | jq -r '.models[0].model_id' | xargs ollama run

# Find the best coding model
whichllm --profile coding --top 1 --json | jq -r '.models[0].model_id' | xargs ollama run
```

### Shell alias

Add to your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias bestllm='whichllm --top 1 --json | jq -r ".models[0].model_id"'
# Usage: ollama run $(bestllm)
```

## Scoring

Each model gets a 0-100 score. Benchmark quality and size form the core;
evidence confidence and runtime fit then scale it, with speed, source
trust, and popularity as adjustments.

| Factor | Effect | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Benchmark quality | core | Merged LiveBench / Artificial Analysis / Aider / Vision / Arena ELO / Open LLM Leaderboard, weighted by source confidence |
| Model size | up to 35 | `log2`-scaled world-knowledge proxy (MoE uses total params) |
| Quantization | × penalty | Lower-bit quants discounted multiplicatively |
| Evidence confidence | ×0.55–1.0 | none / self-reported ×0.55, inherited ×0.78, direct full |
| Runtime fit | ×0.50–1.0 | partial-offload ×0.72, CPU-only ×0.50 |
| Speed | -8 to +8 | Usability gate vs a fit-dependent tok/s floor |
| Source trust | -5 to +5 | Official-org bonus, known-repackager penalty |
| Popularity | tie-breaker | Downloads/likes; weight shrinks as evidence strengthens |

Score markers:
- **`~`** (yellow) — No direct benchmark; score inherited/interpolated from the model family
- **`?`** (yellow) — No benchmark data available

## How it works

### Data pipeline

1. **Model fetching** — Fetches popular models from HuggingFace API:
   - Text-generation (downloads + recently updated)
   - GGUF-filtered (separate query for coverage)
   - Vision models (`image-text-to-text`) when `--profile vision` or `any`
2. **Benchmark sources** — *Current tier* (LiveBench, Artificial Analysis
   Index, Aider) merged live when reachable, plus a curated multimodal /
   vision index; *frozen tier* (Open LLM Leaderboard v2, Chatbot Arena
   ELO). Tiers have separate caps and lineage-aware recency demotion so
   stale leaderboards stop over-rewarding older generations.
3. **Benchmark evidence** — Five resolution levels, increasingly discounted:
   - `direct` — Exact model ID match
   - `variant` — Suffix-stripped or -Instruct variant
   - `base_model` — Base model from cardData
   - `line_interp` — Size-aware interpolation within model family
   - `self_reported` — Uploader-claimed eval (heavily discounted)

   Inheritance is rejected when a model's params diverge more than 2× from
   its family's dominant member, catching draft / MTP / abliterated forks
   that share a `family_id` with a much larger base.
4. **Cache** — `~/.cache/whichllm/`:
   - `models.json` — 6h TTL
   - `benchmark.json` — 24h TTL

### Ranking engine

1. **Hardware detection** — NVIDIA (nvidia-ml-py), AMD (dbgpu/ROCm), Apple Silicon (Metal), CPU cores, RAM, disk
2. **VRAM estimation** — Weights + KV cache + activation + framework overhead (~500MB)
3. **Compatibility** — Full GPU / Partial Offload / CPU-only; compute capability and OS checks
4. **Speed** — tok/s from GPU memory bandwidth lookup (constants.py)
5. **Scoring** — Benchmark (with confidence dampening), size, quantization penalty, fit type, speed, popularity, source trust (official vs repackager)
6. **Backend filter** — Apple Silicon and CPU-only restrict to GGUF for stability; Linux+NVIDIA allows AWQ/GPTQ
