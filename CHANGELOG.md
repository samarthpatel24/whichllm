# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.5.8] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `--context-length` now accepts shorthand values such as `64k` and `128k`.
- JSON ranking output now includes benchmark source and confidence metadata.
- Asahi Linux / Apple Silicon detection now recognizes Apple CPU and GPU names.
- Added GPU catalog coverage for `NVIDIA RTX A3000 Laptop GPU`, `RTX 3050`,
  `RTX 5060`, `RTX 5070 Ti`, `RX 9070`, and `RX 9070 XT`.

### Fixed

- A3000 Laptop 6GB systems no longer get `0.0 tok/s` / heavy partial-offload
  recommendations at the top just because bandwidth was missing.
- Windows CPU detection now falls back through PowerShell/CIM when `wmic` does
  not return a useful CPU name.
- Models that cannot hold the requested context are demoted instead of staying
  near the top of the ranking.
- Hugging Face and benchmark fetches now retry transient failures such as 429s
  before falling back or failing.
- `Error fetching models:` now includes useful detail even when the underlying
  network exception message is empty.
- Upgrade tables now show `0 GB` VRAM instead of treating zero as missing.

### Changed

- Curated registry data was split out of `constants.py` into
  `whichllm.data.*` modules.
- Troubleshooting and cache documentation now better explain disk-cache paths
  and stale fetch behavior.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- LiveBench fallback data is now kept inline so benchmark scoring remains
  available without relying on a generated sidecar file.

### Fixed

- DGX Spark / NVIDIA GB10 is now detected as a shared-memory NVIDIA GPU when
  NVIDIA reports `memory.total` as unavailable.
- `whichllm run` now provides a Transformers `offload_folder`, avoiding crashes
  when large models need disk offload.
- Cache paths now respect `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, including ignoring relative values
  per the XDG base directory specification.
- Apple Silicon is now treated as shared memory in fit detection.
- Benchmark score fetching now runs concurrently.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Speed estimates now include confidence metadata and an estimated tok/s range
  in table and JSON output, so uncertain backend/model predictions are visible.
- Windows now has an AMD/Intel GPU detection fallback via
  `Win32_VideoController`, including 64-bit registry memory reads for GPUs
  where `AdapterRAM` is capped around 4 GB.

### Fixed

- MoE speed estimates now use active-parameter metadata and a
  bandwidth-scaled read floor, improving shared-memory APU estimates without
  over-promoting sparse models on high-bandwidth GPUs.
- Newer MoE model metadata now recognizes A3B-style active-parameter names.
- Ryzen AI / Radeon 890M-class Windows iGPUs are modeled as shared-memory AMD
  GPUs instead of CPU-only or tiny-VRAM discrete GPUs.
- Mixed dedicated-GPU plus shared-memory-iGPU systems no longer sum unrelated
  memory pools as one full-GPU target.
- Windows AMD GPUs no longer receive a misleading ROCm-only warning when
  Vulkan or DirectML backends may be valid.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- `whichllm run` now resolves auto-picked GGUF recommendations to a real
  GGUF repository and file before launch, instead of falling back to the
  official Transformers repository. This fixes the accidental Transformers path
  for models such as `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B`.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Strix Halo / Ryzen AI MAX systems are now modeled as AMD shared-memory APUs
  instead of tiny-VRAM discrete GPUs. `STRXLGEN`, `Radeon 8050S`,
  `Radeon 8060S`, and related names get a 256 GB/s bandwidth estimate and use
  the system shared-memory pool for fit checks, avoiding false CPU-only,
  99%-offload, and `0 tok/s` recommendations.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Linux Intel integrated GPU detection via `/sys/class/drm`, so Intel iGPU
  systems are no longer always treated as CPU-only.
- NVIDIA `nvidia-smi` fallback detection when pynvml is missing, NVML init
  fails, or NVML reports no devices.
- Apple-prefixed Apple Silicon simulator aliases, so `--gpu "Apple M3 Max"`
  resolves the same way as `--gpu "M3 Max"`.

### Fixed

- `whichllm run` transformers chat generation now passes tokenizer mappings
  into `model.generate(**inputs)`, fixing the `KeyError: 'shape'` crash path.
- RTX 5060 Ti bandwidth lookup now reports 448 GB/s instead of `N/A`.

### Changed

- README install guidance now prefers `uvx` / `uv tool install`.
- Removed the old marketing note from the repository and added sponsor metadata.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Curated vision-language benchmark source (`benchmark_sources/vision.py`):
  a 0-100 multimodal capability index (MMMU-Pro / MMBench / general
  multimodal, 2026-05) covering the Qwen3-VL / Qwen2.5-VL / Qwen2-VL /
  Llama-Vision / Phi-vision / Gemma-3 / Pixtral / InternVL3 lines.
- Benchmark snapshot date is now shown under every ranking so a stale
  recommendation is self-evident instead of silently trusted.
- Round 3 regression suite (`tests/test_r3_regressions.py`, 20 tests),
  each verified to fail when its fix is reverted.

### Fixed

- `--profile vision` generation inversion: text leaderboards do not
  score VLMs, so the only model with a direct hit was a
  two-generations-old Qwen2-VL-7B, which outranked the current
  Qwen3-VL-32B even on an 80 GB GPU. Vision models now score from the
  curated multimodal index (Qwen3-VL-32B leads at 73-76).
- Apple Silicon partial-offload speed was estimated ~3x too low: the
  flat 0.45x PCIe penalty was applied to unified memory, where spilled
  weights stay in the same high-bandwidth pool. DeepSeek-R1-class
  models on M2/M3 Ultra now report a realistic 4-15 t/s instead of
  ~1.7. Discrete GPUs keep the 0.45x penalty.
- Duplicate `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct` key in the LiveBench
  fallback (silently scored 62 instead of the intended 58, and broke
  CI lint via ruff F601).
- `ruff format` / `ruff check` are now clean across the codebase, so
  the Lint CI job passes (it was red for the entire 0.5.1 release).

### CI

- GitHub Actions updated to the Node 24 runtime (`checkout@v5`,
  `setup-python@v6`); the Node 20 actions are deprecated from 2026-06.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- `whichllm upgrade` subcommand: side-by-side comparison of the current
  machine against potential GPU upgrades, with a verdict (worth it /
  meaningful / marginal / flat / downgrade).
- Apple Silicon support in `--gpu` flag (M1-M4 base / Pro / Max / Ultra)
  so simulator runs no longer fuzzy-match to ATI Rage Mobility-M1 and
  emit spurious AMD ROCm warnings.
- Curated LiveBench, Arena AA, and Aider benchmark source modules with
  frozen 2026-Q2 fallbacks for offline operation.
- Curated entries for reasoning / thinking lines: `Qwen/QwQ-32B`,
  `Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507`, `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B/14B` and
  `Llama-8B`.
- Frontier-model surfacing for 2026-Q2 releases that do not auto-surface
  via cardinality (Kimi-K2, MiMo, DeepSeek-V4, GLM-5, Qwen3.6/Next,
  gpt-oss, Llama-4, Mistral Small/Large, Devstral, Codestral, MiniMax,
  Granite 3.3/4.0, Olmo-3, Nemotron-3).
- VRAM-aware auto floor for `--profile general` so tiny GPUs surface
  full-GPU 3-4B picks instead of partial-offload-only 7B+.

### Changed

- VRAM estimation: KV cache scaled to 3.5 MB / billion-param / Kctx (was
  0.5 MB) so 128K contexts are realistic; MoE KV uses active*4 to model
  attention head sharing; activation overhead refined.
- Speed estimation: per-quant efficiency table, per-backend multiplier
  (CUDA 1.0, Apple 0.82, AMD 0.78, Intel 0.65), MoE active-ratio floor,
  partial-offload penalty.
- Ranking: composite family selection key replaces tier dominance;
  size_score cap 20 → 35; MoE size_score uses total params;
  `_knowledge_capacity_b` so `--min-params` no longer hides
  Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B on its 3B active.
- Benchmark merging splits frozen (OLLB v2, Arena ELO) from current
  (AA, LiveBench, Aider) with separate caps and lineage-aware recency
  demotion so stale 2024-era leaderboards stop over-rewarding older
  generations.
- httpx `AsyncClient` uses `follow_redirects=True` so case-mismatch HF
  URLs (307) no longer silently drop frontier IDs.

### Fixed

- Reject benchmark inheritance when actual params differ by more than
  2x from the family's dominant member, catching draft/MTP/abliterated
  forks that share a `family_id` with their much larger base
  (e.g. a 6.6B "imatrix-aligned" inheriting from a 158B base).
- Family grouping prefers the upstream-referenced model as the family
  base instead of the highest-downloads member, so a popular fork no
  longer overrides the official base for `family_id` assignment.
- MoE active-parameter registry corrected (gpt-oss-20b 3.6B,
  gpt-oss-120b 5.1B, MiniMax-M2 10B).
- Quality floor (≥ 20) and speed floor (≥ 1.5 t/s) drop junk Q1_0 /
  Bonsai-class attack vectors.
- 11 non-existent HF IDs removed from curated fallbacks (Kimi K2.5/K2.6,
  GLM-5-Turbo, OLMo-3-32B, Llama-3.2-8B, Codestral-25.08, Mistral-Large-3
  etc.).
