## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports
Open an issue with:
- Your hardware (GPU model, VRAM, OS)
- Python version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

### Feature Requests
Open an issue describing the feature and why it would be useful.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (`pytest`)
5. Submit a PR

### AI-assisted Contributions
AI-assisted code is welcome. Use the tools that help you move faster. Working
code wins.

The bar is practical: make it work, make it fit the project, and make it
reviewable. If you wrote it or asked a tool to write it, you own it. Read it,
test the parts that matter, and be ready to explain or fix it.

### Adding GPU Support
To add a new GPU to the bandwidth database, edit `src/whichllm/constants.py` and add the GPU specs.

## Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions
- Use type hints
- Add tests for new functionality
